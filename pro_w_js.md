# Programming with JavaScript

**javascript makes pages more interactive**
- Access content
- Modify content
- Program rules - specify a set of steps for a browser.
- React to events - specify what should happen when a specific event occurs.


**A script is a set of instructions**
- a computer follows them step by step just like a cook book or a repair manual

**writing a script**
- you must first state you goal and list the tasks that need to be completed  in order to achieve it.

1. define the goal
2. design the script
3. code each step

**you need to develope a programmatic approach to problem solving. understand syntax, and know the vocabulary of the language**

expressions have two types of expressions
an expression that assigns a value to a variable
> var color = 'red';
color is now red

or expressions that use two or more values to return a single value.
> var area = 3 * 2;
value of area is now 6

expressions rely on operators. they create a single value from one or more values.

**arithmic operators** use numbers
**+, -, /, *,** 
**++** increment - adds one to current number
**--** decrement - subtracts one from current number
**%** modulous - divides two values and returns remainder

need to know the order of execution

**string operators** the + symbol is the only string operator. it is used to join string on either side of it.

## functions
- funtions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. functions can be reused.
- To create a function give it a name then write the statements needed to achieve the task inside curly braces. This is a function declaration. 
- Once you've declared a function you can then execute all the statements in the curly braces with just one line code, this is calling the function.
- You give a function parameters when it needs specific information to perform a task, inside the function parameters act like variables.
- When you call a function that has parameters you specified the values that you knew. the values are called arguments.
