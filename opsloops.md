###logical operators
- **&&** logical and - tests more than one condition

- **!** logical not - inverts a single boolean value

## loops

> loops check a condition, if it returns **true** a code block will run, and it will be checked again and again until it is returned **false**.

3 main types.
1. **for** - run a specific number of times.
2. **while** - if you do not know how many time it should run, but need a certain answer.
3. **do while** - similar to the while but will always run the statements inside curly braces at least once, even if false.
