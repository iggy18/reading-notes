how do computers work?

what makes a computer a computer?
a computer always does four things

1. take input
2. store info
3. process
4. output results

in the past computers were huge and only crunched numbers. today computers can play music, cat videos, video games, and print 3d objects.

- to **input** information you use a keyboard, mouse, touch screen, etc...
- the computer moves input into **storage**
- the CPU **processes** whats in storage it using algorythms.
- then **outputs** the results into the real world


**computers work with ones and zeros**
electricity is turned on or off in a circuit, this creates information as a 1 or A 0, also known as a bit.

**bit** - on off state of wire. smallest information.

- any number, letter, visual, or audio can be represented with binary number systems.

**circuits**
- circuits together can make logic gates.
- the millions of simple circuits inside computers are how computers performs tasks.
- circuits used to be huge. now, they can be microscopic and the smaller a circuit is the faster it is because the signal doesnt have to travel as far.

**hardware and software**
hardware
circuits, chips, wires, speakers, plugs

**software**
code, programs, apps, web pages.

**how do they interact**
CPU controls all other parts of computer.
recives simple commands and stores them in memory.

**software tells the CPU what to do.**

**operating system.**
the master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer.
the operating system is what lets the programs you use talkj to the hardware in youru computer.
