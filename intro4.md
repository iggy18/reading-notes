## beginner's guide to big O notation

- Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm, specifically, the worst case scenario. 

- **O(1)** describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.

- **O(N)** describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.

- **O(N2)** represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.

- O(2N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each additon to the input data set. 

- binary search is a technique used to search sorted data sets. it works bby selecting the middle element if the data set, compares it against a target value. it the target value is higher it will take the upper half and perform the same operation on that. it continues to half the data set until the target is found or there is nothing left.
