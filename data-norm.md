# Database Normalization

- Database normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns.

- three main reasons to normalize a database.
1.  minimize duplicate data.
2. minimize or avoid data modification issues.
3. to simplify queries.

- tables should only have one purpose.

## database normalization forms
1. First Normal Form – The information is stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values. There are no repeating groups of columns.
2. Second Normal Form – The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the table’s primary key.
3. Third Normal Form – the table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key
