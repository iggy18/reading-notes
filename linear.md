# linear regression

- Scikit-learn is a powerful Python module for machine learning. It contains function for regression, classification, clustering, model selection and dimensionality reduction.

- Regression searches for relationships among variables.

- The dependent features are called the dependent variables, outputs, or responses.

- The independent features are called the independent variables, inputs, or predictors.

- Typically, you need regression to answer whether and how some phenomenon influences the other or how several variables are related.

- Underfitting occurs when a model can’t accurately capture the dependencies among data, usually as a consequence of its own simplicity.

- Overfitting happens when a model learns both dependencies among data and random fluctuations.

- The package NumPy is a fundamental Python scientific package that allows many high-performance operations on single- and multi-dimensional arrays.

- The package scikit-learn is a widely used Python library for machine learning, built on top of NumPy and some other packages. It provides the means for preprocessing data, reducing dimensionality, implementing regression, classification, clustering, and more. 

- There are five basic steps when you’re implementing linear regression:

- Import the packages and classes you need.
- Provide data to work with and eventually do appropriate transformations.
- Create a regression model and fit it with existing data.
- Check the results of model fitting to know whether the model is satisfactory.
- Apply the model for predictions.
