- **foreground color** specify color of text *inside* an element.
**background color** color for the background of that box.

- **RGB values** express a color in term of the red/green/blue/ values and look like this ***6,7,42***
- **Hexcodes** are six digit codes that represent the amount of RGB in a color and look like this***#6x7e42***
- **Color** names presented by predefined names
- **Hue** is basically the colloquial idea of a color.
- **saturation** the amount of gray in a color
