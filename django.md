# django
## from concept to app freaky faast

- django is fast, fully loaded, reassuringly secure, scalable, and versatile.
- Django was originally developed at the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper by Adrian Holovaty, Simon Willison, and Jacob Kaplan-Moss

- Django follows the "Batteries included" philosophy and provides almost everything developers might want to do "out of the box".

-  It can work with any client-side framework, and can deliver content in almost any format (including HTML, RSS feeds, JSON, XML, etc).

- Django helps developers avoid many common security mistakes by providing a framework that has been engineered to "do the right things" to protect the website automatically. 

- Django uses a component-based “shared-nothing” architecture (each part of the architecture is independent of the others, and can hence be replaced or changed if needed).

- URLs: While it is possible to process requests from every single URL via a single function, it is much more maintainable to write a separate view function to handle each resource.

- View: A view is a request handler function, which receives HTTP requests and returns HTTP responses.

- Models: Models are Python objects that define the structure of an application's data, and provide mechanisms to manage (add, modify, delete) and query records in the database.

- Templates: A template is a text file defining the structure or layout of a file (such as an HTML page), with placeholders used to represent actual content.
