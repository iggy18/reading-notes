- Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript. Use JavaScript operators like if or the conditional operator to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.

- In rare cases you might want a component to hide itself even though it was rendered by another component. To do this return null instead of its render output.
