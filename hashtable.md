# hashtable

- Hash - A hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose. 

- Buckets - A bucket is what is contained in each index of the array of the hashtable. Each index is a bucket.

-Collisions - A collision is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.

- Hashtables are a data structure that utilize key value pairs. This means every Node or Bucket has both a key, and a value.

- The basic idea of a hashtable is the ability to store the key into this data structure, and quickly retrieve the value. 

- internal methods of this data structure are add() find() contains, and get_hash().
