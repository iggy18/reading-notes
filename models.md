# models

- seperate models for every object

- use models to represent selection-list options

- Django allows you to define relationships that are one to one `(OneToOneField)`, one to many `(ForeignKey)` and many to many `(ManyToManyField)`.

- Models are usually defined in an application's models.py file.

- They are implemented as subclasses of django.db.models.Model.

- A model can have an arbitrary number of fields, of any type â€” each one represents a column of data that we want to store in one of our database tables. Each database record (row) will consist of one of each field value.
