# javascript refresher and intro to react

- this is my new favorite JS for loop.
- `for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {`
  `console.log(arr[i])`
`}`

- `const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;` this sytax tag is JSX 

- JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript

- Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both.

- React.createElement() performs a few checks to help you write bug-free code.

- An element describes what you want to see on the screen:

- Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects, and are cheap to create. React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements.

- We call this a “root” DOM node because everything inside it will be managed by React DOM.

- The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function

- React is pretty flexible but it has a single strict rule: All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.

- the set up of an element to be rendered the first time is called mounting.

- when an element is cleared it is called unmounting.

- With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.
