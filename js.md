- **Progressive enhancement** is where you start with the skeleton of the page in HTML, decorate in CSS, and add usability in JavaScript.

# creating basic a basic javascript
- javascript is written in plain text like HTML and CSS. 
- when you want to use javascript with a web page you use the the tag '<script>'
- you can put javascript in HTML, but it is better to put it in its own file.

## how to use objects and methods 
- **objects** containers for named values.
- **method** the method tells the object what to do.

javascript runs where it is found in the HTML.

#basic javascript instructions

**statements** - each individual instruction or step in a script. should end with semicolon ;
**comments** you should write comments to explain what your code does. this helps you and others who might be looking at your code.
### **variables** 
- a script will have to temporarily store info it needs to do the job. it stores the data in variables. the data stored in a variable can vary each time the script runs.
- you have to create a variable before you can use it. you do this by typin 'var' and then naming it. 'var example;'

- you can assign a variable a value with an assignment operator. 'var example = 1;'

**there are 3 data types**
1. numeric data.
2. string type data - letters and other characters
3. boolean data - either true or false

- you can use a variable to store a string, a number, or a boolean.

## six rules for naming variables
1. name must begin with a letter, a dollar sign $, or an underscore. **it must not start with a number**
2. name can contain letters $ or _. do not use a dash - or a period in a variable name.
3. cant use keywords or reserved words.
4. variables are case sensitive. it is bad practice to use "no" and "No".
5. use a name that describes the kind of info the variable stores.
6. if your variable has more than one word capitolizeTheBeginningOfEveryOtherWord. you can also use an _.
