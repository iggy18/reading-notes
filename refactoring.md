## What is functional programming?

- Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data
- a pure function returns the same result given the same aruments and doesn't cause any side effects.
- Any function that relies on a random number generator cannot be pure.
- Examples of observable side effects include modifying a global object or a parameter passed by reference.
- mutability is discouraged in functional programming.
- Immutability - unchanging over time or unable to be changed.
-  if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.
- Check for Web APIs before implementing your own functionality
- Cache variables so functions can be read like sentences
